This simulation platform was developed during the PhD of Guilhem Mariotte. It also received contributions from the PhD thesis of SÃ©rgio F. A. Batista for the traffic assignment part. It is one of the outcomes of the [MAGnUM project](https://magnum-erc.weebly.com/), held by Prof. Ludovic Leclercq and funded by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement No 646592).

Designing a simulation
----------------------
In your network folder in the `UserNetworks/` directory, create or edit the scripts `SimulSettings.m` (global settings of the simulation, i.e. duration, timestep, assignment, etc), `ResDef.m` (characteristics of the reservoirs), `DemDef.m` (definition of the macroscopic OD matrix).

Launching a simulation
----------------------
Specify the network, the solver and the name of the output file in the script `Main.m`. Run this script for a classical simulation (with eventually DTA) in the main SymuRes directory. The output of the simulation is always saved into the `outputs/` folder in the corresponding network folder.

Plotting the results of a simulation
------------------------------------
Specify the simulation outputs to load at the beginning of the script `scrPlotResults.m`. Several simulations can be loaded at the same time. Run parts of this script to plot the desired results (accumulations, flows, N-curves, travel times, etc). For each plot script, indicate the relevant list of simulation results, reservoirs, routes to compare.

Original commit

V1.1 - June 2O2O
----------------
Bug fixes in the trip-based solver, add FIFO merge model in the acc-based solver

- AssignCalc.m: put the calculation of route demand here instead of the acc-based solver, when the routes are not predefined
- MFDsolver folder: add the mergeFIFO merge function
- MFDsolver folder: rename and typo fixes for the merge functions
- mergetimeFair: return effective times instead of supply times
- MFDsolver_accbased.m: remove route demand calculation at the beginning (now in AssignCalc.m)
- MFDsolver_accbased.m: fix the queue factor update for the queuedyn model
- MFDsolver_accbased.m: add demfifo option
- MFDsolver_tripbased.m: fix exit supply times per route equal to global entry supply time (FIFO behavior in a succession of reservoirs)
- MFDsolver_tripbased.m: remove waiting veh list per route, keep the global list and add FirstVehPerRoute for exit per route
- MFDsolver_tripbased.m: fix desired entry times within a route (equal to desired exit times of prev reservoir)
- MFDsolver_tripbased.m: fix entry times calculation for demfifo
- MFDsolver_tripbased.m: missing simulation factor on some variables
- MFDsolver_tripbased.m: use directly route demand at the beginning (because now always calculated in AssignCalc.m)
- MFDsolver_tripbased.m: remove MFD linear approximation and apply the simulation factor on MFD param directly
- FDfunctions folder: change variable names of all functions (only inside the functions)
- FDfunctions folder: add conditions (0 <= n).*(n < nj) for the function domain definition
- FDfunctions folder: every function param should be acc or prod (scalable param when using the simu factor in trip-based)
- FDfunctions folder: remove obsolete functions
- Utilityfunctions: add function smoothroute2.m for exact node interpolation
- plotMacroNodes.m: add smoothing option with smoothroute2.m when drawing route paths
- plotRoutes.m: same modification as in plotMacroNodes.m, and now can plot macro nodes
- plotLinkReservoirs.m: plot links and nodes for the given reservoir list only (instead of the full network)
- Main.m: minor typo fixes
